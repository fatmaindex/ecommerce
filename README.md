# 🛒 Ecommerce Store - Angular Professional Implementation

This project is a modern E-commerce frontend built with **Angular 18**, focusing on high-quality architecture and clean code standards.

## ✨ Why this project stands out?
Unlike standard tutorials, this project implements the **Angular Style Guide** for enterprise applications:
* **Feature-based Folders:** Organized by business logic (Auth, Cart, Products) rather than just file types.
* **Clean Models:** Strict TypeScript interfaces for data safety (e.g., `Product` model).
* **Scalable Structure:** Clear separation between `Core` (global logic) and `Shared` (reusable UI) modules.

## 🛠 Features
* **Authentication Flow:** Secure login/register with route guards and JWT interceptors.
* **Product Discovery:** Advanced searching, filtering, and pagination.
* **Shopping Experience:** Full cart management with reactive state.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  `npm install`
2.  `ng serve`
3.  Open `http://localhost:4200/`
